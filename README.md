# C: How to Program, 9th Edition - Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the end-of-chapter problems in "C: How to Program", 9th edition, by Paul Deitel and Harvey Deitel. Each solution aims to demonstrate the programming concepts and techniques introduced in the respective chapters.

## Chapter 2: Input/Output, Types, Arithmetic, Decision Making

This chapter introduces the basics of C programming, including input/output operations, data types, arithmetic operations, and decision-making constructs such as `if` and `if-else` statements. My solutions focus on demonstrating how to use these constructs effectively to solve various problems.

- **Key Topics Covered:**
  - Basic IO operations
  - Data types and their applications
  - Arithmetic operations in C
  - Simple decision making

## Chapter 3: Algorithm Development, if, if/else, while loops

Chapter 3 delves into algorithm development with a focus on control flow constructs such as `if`, `if-else`, and `while` loops. The exercises I completed emphasize developing algorithms to solve problems efficiently and cleanly.

- **Key Topics Covered:**
  - Developing simple algorithms
  - Implementing `if` and `if-else` statements
  - Utilizing `while` loops for repetition

## Chapter 4: Program Control

The fourth chapter expands on program control with additional constructs like `for`, `do/while` loops, `switch` statements, and control flow modifiers `break` and `continue`, along with logical operators. My solutions demonstrate the use of these constructs in more complex program control scenarios.

- **Key Topics Covered:**
  - `for` and `do/while` loops for complex iteration
  - `switch` statements for multi-way branching
  - Logical operators to combine conditions

## Chapter 5: Functions, Custom Functions

In Chapter 5, the book introduces functions, including the definition, creation, and use of custom functions. My solutions showcase how to modularize code and create reusable functions for better code organization and readability.

- **Key Topics Covered:**
  - Defining and invoking functions
  - Passing arguments to functions
  - Building custom reusable functions

## Chapter 6: Arrays, Searching, Sorting

This chapter covers arrays and basic algorithms for searching and sorting. My implementations include examples of linear and binary search, as well as simple sorting algorithms like bubble sort.

- **Key Topics Covered:**
  - Array manipulation
  - Implementing search algorithms
  - Basic sorting techniques

## Chapter 7: Pointers

Chapter 7 introduces pointers, a fundamental concept in C programming for direct memory access and manipulation. My solutions here focus on pointer basics, pointer arithmetic, and using pointers with arrays and functions.

- **Key Topics Covered:**
  - Understanding pointers and their importance
  - Pointer arithmetic
  - Pointers with arrays and functions

## Chapter 8: Characters and Strings

The final chapter I've covered deals with characters and strings, exploring the C standard library's string and character processing functions. Solutions in this chapter demonstrate handling and manipulating strings in C.

- **Key Topics Covered:**
  - Character handling
  - String manipulation using C standard library functions
